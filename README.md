#  E-Commerce CLI App

This app is a command-line-based E-commerce management system for handling customers, products, categories, orders, and order items. Built using SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic, this app allows full CRUD operations and tracks relationships between various entities within a store environment, e.g, customers, orders, and products.

## üì¶ Description

This project simulates a backend for an E-commerce platform. Users can manage inventory and process orders entirely from the terminal using a user-friendly CLI interface. It showcases object-relational modeling, CRUD logic, database migrations, and modular Python project structuring.
